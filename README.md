<h1>ProjectToolBox: Reviving <a href=Reviving http://www.roblox.com/IDE/ClientToolbox.aspx>http://www.roblox.com/IDE/ClientToolbox.aspx</a></h1>
We are trying to rebuild the old Toolbox for ROBLOX versions 2006 - 2009 as if it was like you were on the old family computer!
Some code we used was from GOODBLOX, since the only known working toolbox code was made by the GOODBLOX team.

<h1>Required stuff for ProjectToolBox to run:</h1>
  A website with a backend supporting .aspx files.
  The GitHub Repo.
  Some old ROBLOX clients from before Late 2009.
  Some old ROBLOX Toolbox Models supporting your old ROBLOX clients.
